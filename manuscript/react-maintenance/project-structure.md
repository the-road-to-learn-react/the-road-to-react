## React Project Structure

With multiple React components in one file, you might wonder why we didn't put components into different files from the start. We already have multiple components in the *src/App.jsx* file that can be defined in their own files/folders (sometimes also called modules). For learning, it's more practical to keep these components in one place. Once your application grows, consider splitting these components into multiple files/folders/modules so it scales properly. Before we restructure our React project, recap [JavaScript's import and export statements](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-import-export/), because importing and exporting files are two fundamental concepts in JavaScript you should learn before React.

It's important to note that there's no right way to structure a React application, as they evolve naturally along with the project's requirements. We'll complete a simple refactoring for this project's folder/file structure for the sake of learning about the process. Afterward, there will be an important article as exercise about the folder/file organizations of React projects.

On the command line in your project's folder, create the following files for all of our components in the *src/* folder:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
touch src/list.jsx src/input-with-label.jsx src/search-form.jsx
~~~~~~~

Move every component from the *src/App.jsx* file in its own file, except for the List component which has to share its place with the Item component in the *src/list.jsx* file. Then in every file make sure to import React and to export the component which needs to be used from the file. For example, in *src/list.jsx* file:

{title="src/list.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const List = ({ list, onRemoveItem }) => (
  <ul>
    {list.map((item) => (
      <Item
        key={item.objectID}
        item={item}
        onRemoveItem={onRemoveItem}
      />
    ))}
  </ul>
);

const Item = ({ item, onRemoveItem }) => (
  <li>
    <span>
      <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{item.author}</span>
    <span>{item.num_comments}</span>
    <span>{item.points}</span>
    <span>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => onRemoveItem(item)}>
        Dismiss
      </button>
    </span>
  </li>
);

# leanpub-start-insert
export { List };
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~

Since only the List component uses the Item component, we can keep it in the same file. If this changes because the Item component is used elsewhere, we can give the Item component its own file. Next, the InputWithLabel component gets its dedicated file too:

{title="src/input-with-label.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
import * as React from 'react';
# leanpub-end-insert

const InputWithLabel = ({
  id,
  value,
  type = 'text',
  onInputChange,
  isFocused,
  children,
}) => {
  const inputRef = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (isFocused && inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, [isFocused]);

  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={id}>{children}</label>
      &nbsp;
      <input
        ref={inputRef}
        id={id}
        type={type}
        value={value}
        onChange={onInputChange}
      />
    </>
  );
};

# leanpub-start-insert
export { InputWithLabel };
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~

The SearchForm component in the *src/search-form.jsx* file must import the InputWithLabel component. Like the Item component, we could have left the InputWithLabel component next to the SearchForm; but our goal is to make InputWithLabel component reusable with other components:

{title="src/search-form.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
import { InputWithLabel } from './input-with-label';
# leanpub-end-insert

const SearchForm = ({ searchTerm, onSearchInput, searchAction }) => (
  <form action={searchAction}>
    <InputWithLabel
      id="search"
      value={searchTerm}
      isFocused
      onInputChange={onSearchInput}
    >
      <strong>Search:</strong>
    </InputWithLabel>

    <button type="submit" disabled={!searchTerm}>
      Submit
    </button>
  </form>
);

# leanpub-start-insert
export { SearchForm };
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~

The App component has to import all the components it needs to render. It doesn't need to import InputWithLabel, because it's only used for the SearchForm component.

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
import * as React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

# leanpub-start-insert
import { SearchForm } from './search-form';
import { List } from './list';
# leanpub-end-insert

...

const App = () => {
  ...
};

export default App;
~~~~~~~

Components that are used in other components now have their own file. If a component should be used as a reusable component (e.g. InputWithLabel), it receives its own file. Only if a component (e.g. Item) is dedicated to another component (e.g. List) do we keep it in the same file. From here, there are several strategies to structure your folder/file hierarchy. One scenario is to create a folder for every component:

{title="Project Structure",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
- list/
-- index.jsx
- search-form/
-- index.jsx
- input-with-label/
-- index.jsx
~~~~~~~

The *index.jsx* file holds the implementation details for the component, while other files in the same folder have different responsibilities like styling, testing, and types:

{title="Project Structure",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
- list/
-- index.jsx
-- style.css
-- test.js
-- types.js
~~~~~~~

If using CSS-in-JS, where no CSS file is needed, one could still have a separate *style.js* file for all the styled components:

{title="Project Structure",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
- list/
-- index.jsx
# leanpub-start-insert
-- style.js
# leanpub-end-insert
-- test.js
-- types.js
~~~~~~~

Sometimes we'll need to move from a **technical-oriented folder structure** to a **domain-oriented folder structure**, especially once the project grows. Universal *shared/* folder is shared across domain specific components:

{title="Project Structure",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
- messages.jsx
- users.jsx
- shared/
-- button.jsx
-- input.jsx
~~~~~~~

If you scale this to the deeper level folder structure, each component will have its own folder in a domain-oriented project structure as well:

{title="Project Structure",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~
- messages/
-- index.jsx
-- style.css
-- test.js
-- types.js
- users/
-- index.jsx
-- style.css
-- test.js
-- types.js
- shared/
-- button/
--- index.jsx
--- style.css
--- test.js
--- types.js
-- input/
--- index.jsx
--- style.css
--- test.js
--- types.js
~~~~~~~

There are many ways on how to structure your React project from small to large project: simple to complex folder structure; one-level nested to two-level nested folder nesting; dedicated folders for styling, types, and testing next to implementation logic. There is no right way for folder/file structures. However, in the exercises, you will find my 5 steps approach to structure a React project. After all, a project's requirements evolve over time and so should its structure. If keeping all assets in one file feels right, then there is no rule against it.

### Exercises:

* Compare your source code against the author's [source code](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/hacker-stories/tree/2025_project-structure).
  * Recap all the [source code changes](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/hacker-stories/compare/2025_forms-actions...2025_project-structure) from this section.
* Read more about [React Folder Structures](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure/).
* Keep the current folder structure if you feel confident. The ongoing sections will omit it, only using the *src/App.jsx* file.
