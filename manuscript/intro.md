# Foreword

The Road to React teaches the fundamentals of React. You will build a real-world application in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by myself and the community. In the Road to React, I offer a foundation before you dive into the broader React ecosystem. It explains general concepts, patterns, and best practices for a real world React application. Essentially, you will learn to build your own React application from scratch, with features like pagination, client-side and server-side searching, and advanced interactions like sorting. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript, and that it helps you get started with it.

## About the Author

I am a German software and web developer dedicated to learning and teaching JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I gained experience from the startup world where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time. For a few years, I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company in Berlin, developing large scale JavaScript applications, which eventually led to a desire to teach others about these topics.

During my time as a developer in Berlin, I regularly wrote articles about web development on my website. I received great feedback from people learning from my articles which allowed me to improve my writing and teaching style. Article after article, I grew my ability to teach others. I find it fulfilling seeing students thrive by giving them clear objectives and short feedback loops.

Currently, I am a self-employed developer helping companies in creating their MVPs, conducting workshops and code audits/review, and creating large scale JavaScript applications. You can find more information about me, ways to support me, and how to work with me on my [website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about).

## FAQ

**How to get updates?**

I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive a notification about an update, you can download a new version of the book from my website.

**Is the learning material up-to-date?**

Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self-published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released.

**Can I get a digital copy of the book if I bought it on Amazon?**

If you have bought the book on Amazon, you may have seen that the book is available on my website too.

After creating an account there, write me an email about your purchase with a receipt from Amazon, so that I can unlock the content for you. With an account on my platform, you always have access to the latest version of the book.

**Why is the print copy so large in size?**

If you have purchased the print version of the book, make sure to take notes in the book. It was my intention to keep the printed book extra large, for the sake of giving larger code snippets enough space, but also for giving you enough space to work with it.

If you have feedback, shoot me an email and I will take your suggestions into consideration. Don't expect many replies for bug tracking or troubleshoots though, because that's what's the community for.

**What do I do if I encounter a bug?**

If you encounter any bug in the code, you should find a URL to the current GitHub project at the end of each section. Feel free to open a GitHub issue there. Your help is very much appreciated!

**How to support the project?**

If you find my lessons useful and would like to contribute, seek my website's [about page](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) for information about how to offer support. It is also very helpful for my readers to spread the word about how my books helped them, so others might discover it as ways to improve their web development skills. Contributing through any of the provided channels gives me the freedom to create in-depth courses, and to continue offering free material on my website.

**What's your motivation behind the book?**

I want to teach about this topic consistently. I often find materials online that don't receive updates, or only applies to a small part of a topic. Sometimes people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to provide this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. Also, I hope I can support the less fortunate with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react).

## Who is this book for?

**JavaScript Beginners**

JavaScript beginners with knowledge in fundamental JS, CSS, and HTML: If you just started out with web development, and have a basic grasp about JS, CSS, and HTML, this book should give you everything that's needed to learn React. However, if you feel there is a gap in your JavaScript knowledge, don't hesitate to read up on that topic before continuing with the book. You will have lots of references to fundamental JS knowledge in the book though.

**JavaScript Veterans**

JavaScript veterans coming from jQuery: If you have used JavaScript with jQuery, MooTools, and Dojo extensively back in the days, the new JavaScript era may seem overwhelming for someone getting back on track with it. However, most of the fundamental knowledge didn't change, it's still JavaScript and HTML under the hood, so this book should give you the right start into React.

**JavaScript Enthusiasts**

JavaScript enthusiasts with knowledge in other modern SPA frameworks: If you are coming from Angular or Vue, there may be lots of differences in how to write applications with React, however, all these frameworks share the same fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML. After a mindset shift to get comfortable with React, you should be doing just fine adopting React.

**Non JavaScript Developers**

If you are coming from another programming language, you should be more familiar than others about the different aspects of programming. After picking up the fundamentals about JavaScript and HTML, you should have a good time learning React with me.

**Designers and UI/UX Enthusiasts**

If your main profession is in design, user interaction or user experience, don't hesitate to pick up this book. You may be already quite familiar with HTML and CSS which is a plus. After going through some more JavaScript fundamentals, you should be good to get through this book. These days UI/UX are moving closer to the implementation details which are often taken care of with React. It would be your perfect asset to know how things work in code.

**Team Leads, Product Owners, or Product Managers**

If you are a team lead, product owner or product manager of your development department, this book should give you a good breakdown of all the essential parts in a React application. Every section explains one React concept/pattern/technique to add another feature or to improve the overall architecture. It's a well rounded reference guide for React.
