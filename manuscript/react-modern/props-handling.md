## Props Handling (Advanced)

Props are passed from parent to child down the component tree. Since we use props to transport information from component to component frequently, and sometimes via other components which are in between, it is useful to know a few tricks to make passing props more convenient.

The following refactorings are recommended for you to learn different JavaScript/React patterns, though you can still build complete React applications without them. Consider these as advanced props techniques that will make your React code for certain scenarios more concise, readable, and maintainable.

### Props Destructuring via Object Destructuring

React props are just a JavaScript object, otherwise we couldn't access `props.list` or `props.onSearch` in our React components. Since `props` is an object which just passes information from one component to another component, we can apply a couple JavaScript tricks to it. For example, accessing an object's properties with modern [JavaScript object destructuring](https://mzl.la/30KbXTC):

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const user = {
  firstName: 'Robin',
  lastName: 'Wieruch',
};

// without object destructuring
const firstName = user.firstName;
const lastName = user.lastName;

// with object destructuring
const { firstName, lastName } = user;
~~~~~~~

When we need to access various properties of an object, employing a single line of code rather than multiple lines is often a more straightforward and elegant approach. This is why object destructuring is commonly utilized in JavaScript. Before delving into the upcoming code snippet, attempt to apply this understanding to the React props within our Search component.

Now, let's explore how we can employ props destructuring. Initially, we need to refactor the Search component's arrow function from a concise body to a block body. Subsequently, we can implement the destructuring of the props object within the function body:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
const Search = (props) => {
  const { search, onSearch } = props;
# leanpub-end-insert

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input
        id="search"
        type="text"
# leanpub-start-insert
        value={search}
        onChange={onSearch}
# leanpub-end-insert
      />
    </div>
# leanpub-start-insert
  );
};
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~

That's a basic destructuring of the `props` object in a React component, so that the object's properties can be used conveniently in the component. However, we also had to refactor the Search component's arrow function from concise body into block body to access the properties of `props` with the object destructuring in the component function's body. This would happen quite often if we followed this pattern and it wouldn't make things easier for us, because we would constantly have to refactor our components. We can take all this one step further by destructuring the `props` object right away in the function signature of our component, omitting the function's block body of the component again:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
const Search = ({ search, onSearch }) => (
# leanpub-end-insert
  <div>
    <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
    <input
      id="search"
      type="text"
      value={search}
      onChange={onSearch}
    />
  </div>
 # leanpub-start-insert
);
# leanpub-end-insert
~~~~~~~

React's `props` are rarely used in components by themselves; rather, all the information that is contained in the `props` object is used. By destructuring the `props` object right away in the component's function signature, we can conveniently access all information without dealing with its `props` container. The List and Item components can perform the same props destructuring:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
# leanpub-start-insert
const List = ({ list }) => (
# leanpub-end-insert
  <ul>
# leanpub-start-insert
    {list.map((item) => (
# leanpub-end-insert
      <Item key={item.objectID} item={item} />
    ))}
  </ul>
);

# leanpub-start-insert
const Item = ({ item }) => (
# leanpub-end-insert
  <li>
    <span>
# leanpub-start-insert
      <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
# leanpub-end-insert
    </span>
# leanpub-start-insert
    <span>{item.author}</span>
    <span>{item.num_comments}</span>
    <span>{item.points}</span>
# leanpub-end-insert
  </li>
);
~~~~~~~

The use of object destructuring aligns with JavaScript's best practices and promotes a cleaner and more efficient React component structure. It allows for a more straightforward extraction of the required properties, enhancing both the clarity of the code and the overall development experience in React applications. However, we can take this one step further with some more optional advanced lessons.

### Nested Destructuring

The incoming `item` parameter in the Item component has something in common with the previously discussed `props` parameter: they are both JavaScript objects. Also, even though the `item` object has already been destructured from the `props` in the Item component's function signature, it isn't directly used in the Item component. The `item` object only passes its information (object properties) to the elements.

The current solution is fine as you will see in the ongoing discussion. However, I want to show you two more variations of it, because there are many things to learn about JavaScript objects in React here. Let's get started with *nested destructuring* and how it works:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const user = {
  firstName: 'Robin',
  pet: {
    name: 'Trixi',
  },
};

// without object destructuring
const firstName = user.firstName;
const name = user.pet.name;

console.log(firstName + ' has a pet called ' + name);
// "Robin has a pet called Trixi"

// with nested object destructuring
const {
  firstName,
  pet: {
    name,
  },
} = user;

console.log(firstName + ' has a pet called ' + name);
// "Robin has a pet called Trixi"
~~~~~~~

The nested destructuring helps us to gather all the needed information of the `item` object in the function signature for its immediate usage in the component's elements. Even though it's not the most readable option here, note that it can still be useful in other scenarios:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
// Variation 1: Nested Destructuring

const Item = ({
# leanpub-start-insert
  item: {
    title,
    url,
    author,
    num_comments,
    points,
  },
# leanpub-end-insert
}) => (
  <li>
    <span>
# leanpub-start-insert
      <a href={url}>{title}</a>
# leanpub-end-insert
    </span>
# leanpub-start-insert
    <span>{author}</span>
    <span>{num_comments}</span>
    <span>{points}</span>
# leanpub-end-insert
  </li>
);
~~~~~~~

In summary, nested destructuring in React proves to be a powerful and efficient technique when dealing with complex data structures, especially within nested objects or arrays in props or state. This approach simplifies the extraction of deeply nested values, making the code more concise and readable. However, nested destructuring introduces lots of clutter through indentations in the function signature. While here it's not the most readable option, it can be useful in other scenarios though.

### Spread and Rest Operators

Let's take another approach with JavaScript's spread and rest operators. In order to prepare for it, we will refactor our List and Item components to the following implementation. Rather than passing the item as an object from List to Item component, we are passing every property of the `item` object:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
// Variation 2: Spread and Rest Operators
// 1. Step

const List = ({ list }) => (
  <ul>
    {list.map((item) => (
      <Item
        key={item.objectID}
# leanpub-start-insert
        title={item.title}
        url={item.url}
        author={item.author}
        num_comments={item.num_comments}
        points={item.points}
# leanpub-end-insert
      />
    ))}
  </ul>
);

# leanpub-start-insert
const Item = ({ title, url, author, num_comments, points }) => (
# leanpub-end-insert
  <li>
    <span>
      <a href={url}>{title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{author}</span>
    <span>{num_comments}</span>
    <span>{points}</span>
  </li>
);
~~~~~~~

Now, even though the Item component's function signature is more concise, the clutter ended up in the List component instead, because every property is passed to the Item component individually. We can improve this approach using [JavaScript's spread operator](https://mzl.la/3jetIkn):

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const profile = {
  firstName: 'Robin',
  lastName: 'Wieruch',
};

const address = {
  country: 'Germany',
  city: 'Berlin',
};

const user = {
  ...profile,
  gender: 'male',
  ...address,
};

console.log(user);
// {
//   firstName: "Robin",
//   lastName: "Wieruch",
//   gender: "male"
//   country: "Germany,
//   city: "Berlin",
// }
~~~~~~~

JavaScript's spread operator allows us to literally spread all key/value pairs of an object to another object. This can also be done in React's JSX. Instead of passing each property one at a time via props from List to Item component as before, we can use JavaScript's spread operator to pass all the object's key/value pairs as attribute/value pairs to a JSX element:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
// Variation 2: Spread and Rest Operators
// 2. Step

const List = ({ list }) => (
  <ul>
    {list.map((item) => (
# leanpub-start-insert
      <Item key={item.objectID} {...item} />
# leanpub-end-insert
    ))}
  </ul>
);

const Item = ({ title, url, author, num_comments, points }) => (
  <li>
    <span>
      <a href={url}>{title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{author}</span>
    <span>{num_comments}</span>
    <span>{points}</span>
  </li>
);
~~~~~~~

This refactoring made the process of passing the information from List to Item component more concise. Finally, we'll use JavaScript's rest destructuring as the icing on the cake. The JavaScript rest operation happens always as the last part of an object destructuring:

{title="Code Playground",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const user = {
  id: '1',
  firstName: 'Robin',
  lastName: 'Wieruch',
  country: 'Germany',
  city: 'Berlin',
};

const { id, country, city, ...userWithoutAddress } = user;

console.log(userWithoutAddress);
// {
//   firstName: "Robin",
//   lastName: "Wieruch"
// }

console.log(id);
// "1"

console.log(city);
// "Berlin"
~~~~~~~

Even though both have the same syntax (three dots), the rest operator shouldn't be mistaken with the spread operator. Whereas the rest operator happens on the left side of an assignment, the spread operator happens on the right side. The rest operator is always used to separate an object from some of its properties.

Now it can be used in our List component to separate the `objectID` from the item, because the `objectID` is only used as a `key` and isn't used in the Item component. Only the remaining (read: rest) item gets spread as attribute/value pairs into the Item component (as before):

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
// Variation 2: Spread and Rest Operators
// Final Step

const List = ({ list }) => (
  <ul>
# leanpub-start-insert
    {list.map(({ objectID, ...item }) => (
      <Item key={objectID} {...item} />
# leanpub-end-insert
    ))}
  </ul>
);

const Item = ({ title, url, author, num_comments, points }) => (
  <li>
    <span>
      <a href={url}>{title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{author}</span>
    <span>{num_comments}</span>
    <span>{points}</span>
  </li>
);
~~~~~~~

In this final variation, the rest operator is used to destructure the `objectID` from the rest of the `item` object. Afterward, the `item` is spread with its key/value pairs into the Item component. While this final variation is very concise, it comes with advanced JavaScript features that may be unknown to some.

In this section, we have learned about JavaScript object destructuring which can be commonly used not only for the `props` object, but also for other objects like the `item` object which are nested within the props. We have also seen how nested destructuring can be used (Variation 1), but also how it didn't add any benefits in our case because it just made the component bigger. In the future, you are more likely to find use cases for nested destructuring which are beneficial.

Last but not least, you have learned about JavaScript's spread and rest operators, which shouldn't be confused with each other, to perform operations on JavaScript objects and to pass the `props` object from one component to another component in the most concise way. In the end, I want to point out the initial version again which we will continue to use in the next sections:

{title="src/App.jsx",lang="javascript"}
~~~~~~~
const List = ({ list }) => (
  <ul>
    {list.map((item) => (
      <Item key={item.objectID} item={item} />
    ))}
  </ul>
);

const Item = ({ item }) => (
  <li>
    <span>
      <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
    </span>
    <span>{item.author}</span>
    <span>{item.num_comments}</span>
    <span>{item.points}</span>
  </li>
);
~~~~~~~

It may not be the most concise, but it is the easiest to understand. Variation 1 with its nested destructuring didn't add much benefit and variation 2 added too many advanced JavaScript features (spread operator, rest operator) which are not familiar to everyone. After all, all these variations have their pros and cons. When refactoring a component, always aim for readability, especially when working in a team of people, and make sure everyone is using a common React code style.

Rules of thumb:

* Almost always use object destructuring for props in a function component's function signature, because props are rarely used themselves. Exception: When props are only passed through the component to the next child component (see when to use spread operator).
* Use the spread operator when you want to pass all key/value pairs of an object to a child component in JSX. For example, often props themselves are not used in a component but only passed along to the next component. Then it makes sense to just spread the props object `{...props}` to the next component.
* Use the rest operator when you only want to split out certain properties from your props object.
* Use nested destructuring only when it improves readability.

### Interview Questions:

* Question: How do you destructure props in a function component's parameters?
  * Answer: You can destructure props directly in the function parameters, like this: `function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }) {...}`.
* Question: Can you provide a default value while destructuring props?
  * Answer: Yes, you can provide default values during destructuring, such as `{ prop1 = 'default', prop2 }`.
* Question: Is it necessary to destructure all props, or can you choose specific ones?
  * Answer: You can choose to destructure specific props based on your component's needs, leaving others untouched.
* Question: How is the spread operator (...) used in React props?
  * Answer: The spread operator is used to pass all properties of an object as separate props to a React component, like `<MyComponent {...obj} />`.
* Question: Can you use the spread operator to combine props with additional ones?
  * Answer: Yes, you can combine existing props with additional ones using the spread operator, like `<MyComponent {...props} newProp={value} />`.
* Question: Does the spread operator create a shallow or deep copy of an object?
  * Answer: The spread operator creates a shallow copy of an object, meaning nested objects are still references to the original.
* Question: What is the purpose of the rest operator (...rest) in React?
  * Answer: The rest operator is used to collect remaining properties into a new object, often used in combination with props destructuring.
* Question: Why is array destructuring used for React Hooks like `useState` and object destructuring for props?
  * Answer: A React Hook like `useState` returns an array whereas props are an object; hence we need to apply the appropriate operation for the underlying data structure. The benefit of having an array returned from `useState` is that the values can be given any name in the destructuring operation.
* Question: What is prop drilling in React?
  * Answer: Prop drilling is the process of passing props through multiple layers of components to reach a deeply nested child component.
